# Splunk Vagrant

This is a super quick and barebones way to get up an running with Splunk.

This is handy for an impromptu demo or maybe for a home lab.

**Note:** The resulting Splunk installation will come up with terrible default credentials.  You should change them.  You have been warned.

# What Prerequisites Do I Need?

 1. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), of course.
 2. Vagrant depends on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), so
        you'll need that too.
 3. A Splunk Account, so that you can download the Free Splunk Enterprise rpm.  You get both of those things at [https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html) .
 4. Make sure you download the Splunk rpm to the same directory as this Vagrantfile
 5. Rename the Splunk rpm to `splunk.rpm`

# What Do I Need to Change in The Vagrantfile?

Depending on your environment, you will likely have to change which network interface that you want Vagrant to bridge.  So, instead of:

    config.vm.network "public_network", :bridge => "eno1"

*eno1* may have to change to...whatever your NIC is called.

# Then What?

That's it!
Open a terminal, change to the directory where this Vagrantfile is and:

    vagrant up

After a few minutes, the terminal should tell you where to access your new Splunk installation.

Default credentials are:
 - **Username:** admin
 - **Password:** password
